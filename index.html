    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
  </p>According to the prompt for this assignment, I am supposed to "Use your own creative freedom to create the best user experience possible." Therefore, I decided to redesign the application concept to be a bit more engaging than the prompt's concept, <b>while also being sure to include the same functionality in its totality.</b> Because the topic of the applet is rather rudimentary, (simple probability) and understanding Codecademy's emphasis on education, I concluded that this theoretical applet might be best thought of as an educational tool for younger students. With this assumption in mind, I set out to create an interface that would be engaging for young learners and still include all the functionality specified by the prompt. Note that my skills are not limited to just creating interfaces for children, that's simply how I interpreted this particular prompt.</p>

  <p>Instead of marbles in a bag, I thought fish in a pond would be more interesting. In this analogy, the fisherman (the user) experiences probability by engaging with the fish. Orange fish substitute the orange marbles from the prompt. Instead of blue fish to substitute blue marbles, I used light green fish, because I wanted them to stand out against the blue water and sky.</p>
  <h2>Additional Functionality (Not Included in the Prompt)</h2>
  <p>Aside from the obvious thematic and graphical changes, I included some additional functionality features as a testament to my skill and hard-working commitment to this position.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Add Fish: </b> This feature lets the user add fish to the pond, with access to more than just the two default colors. This feature can be disabled with <i>settings.features.addFish=false</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Fish Replacement: </b> I wasn't sure if you wanted the user to be able to remove fish from their bank and re-deposit them into the main pond. In my program, this is enabled by default, but can be disabled with <i>settings.features.allowReturnFishFromBucket=false</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Percentage: </b> For each color of fish, I included the probability as a fraction <i>and</i> the probability as a percentage.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <p>My code is well organized and thoroughly commented. But, I figured I'd also take this oppertunity to highlight some of the features that may set my submission apart from other applicants.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Design & Code: </b> I wanted my creation to stand out with a unique design. While it may look simple from a cursory glance, there is a fair amount of thought and math going on under the hood. Consider how the water waves are constructed using sine functions, or how the fish have been brought to life with their own movement. (Much more interesting than marbles in a bag!)</li>
    <li><b>Attention to Detail: </b> I put a great deal of detail into all of my work. Notice how the fisherman breathes subtly, as his leg lazily drifts back and forth over the water.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I hope my hard work, drive, and technical skill is evident in this submission. I understand that this may not be exactly what you were expecting, but you did ask me to be creative! Please rest assured that for a more serious task, I'm happy to follow a relatively restrictive prompt and build something according to more percise specifications. But for this submission, I wanted to go above and beyond.</p>
    <p>I really hope you will consider me for this position, and I'm so excited to hear from you!</p>
